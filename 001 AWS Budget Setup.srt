1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,320
So in this account,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,640
we're going to make sure to spend

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,140
the least amount of money or no money,

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,370
and I will let you know when something

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,270
will cost you some money.

6
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,830
But nonetheless, it is a good idea

7
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,315
to set up a billing budget

8
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:12,750
so that we know when we go over spending some money

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,820
and we can get alerted in case of that.

10
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,610
So what I'm going to do is click on My Account,

11
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,010
and then click on My Billing Dashboard.

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,885
Now as you can see, I need permissions,

13
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,400
and this is because I'm logged in

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,380
as an IAM user on my account,

15
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,330
and we need to change something on the root account

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,635
before we get access with IAM users, even administrators,

17
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,810
to the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard.

18
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,870
So to solve this I logged in as my root account,

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,760
as you can see, now it just says my account number,

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,810
it doesn't say the IAM user,

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,059
so I'm logged in as my root account,

22
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,960
and then I click on My Accounts.

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,490
So you need to be your root account to do this.

24
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,610
You scroll down and you're going to find this one setting

25
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,450
called IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information.

26
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,441
And we'll edit this

27
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,450
and we'll activate IAM access,

28
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,840
and this will allow IAM users who are administrators

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,550
to access billing data.

30
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,383
If you don't want that,

31
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:01,740
you can also set up a billing alarm

32
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,510
using the root account, if you wanted to.

33
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,099
But I want to show you how to set up a billing alarm

34
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,180
using an IAM user,

35
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,250
in case this is something you wanted to do.

36
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,533
So once this setting is activated,

37
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,088
you can go back into your IAM user,

38
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,740
and then refresh this page.

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,950
So here we are in the AWS Billing Dashboard home,

40
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,230
and this is where you can see the charges for your month.

41
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,150
We do the best to remain within the free tier,

42
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,100
but sometimes, if you have any charge,

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,060
you would see it here,

44
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,230
and then let me show you

45
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,780
how you can find the source of your charge.

46
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,995
So if you go on the left hand side into Bills,

47
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,650
and you are on this Bills page,

48
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,890
just click on try the new bills page experience

49
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,290
to get to this interface.

50
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,510
Okay, so once we are here in this interface,

51
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,160
you would see your grand total,

52
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,390
and then you can scroll down

53
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,450
and you can go to Charges by Service.

54
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,490
And this is to see which service

55
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,470
is incurring you some charges.

56
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,450
So for example, if I go and scroll down

57
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,320
and go into my Elastic Compute Cloud service,

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,870
I can see that 62 cents were incurred

59
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,840
in the US East, Northern Virginia region.

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,380
So I click on it and open this in a new page.

61
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,202
And on the new UI, I see that, yes, this is the charge,

62
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:13,170
and it comes from the EBS part of it.

63
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,880
So this is the Usage Description,

64
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
and it says that I've been using

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
a six gigabyte month of the gp2 type of EBS volume.

66
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,340
So this information is enough for me

67
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,850
to figure out that I've probably left a volume unused

68
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,870
in my accounts.

69
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,530
So I would go into the Elastic Compute Cloud console

70
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,170
I would switch to the Northern Virginia region,

71
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,170
using the top right hand side dropdown,

72
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,940
and then I would go into the EBS section

73
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,600
and delete this volume that's been incurring charges to me.

74
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,510
So it's up to you, of course, to debug your own costs,

75
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,780
and so this is the way you would do it.

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,790
Also, if you go over the free tier,

77
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,260
this is going to be on the left hand side.

78
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,640
So if you go on the left hand side,

79
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,924
you will see all your services,

80
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,800
as well as what is the free tier usage

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,988
and your current usage.

82
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:03,000
So you know right away if you are, for example,

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,490
at 100% of your free tier

84
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,140
or if you're about to hit it and so on,

85
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,940
so this really helps you to understand

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,790
what you've been doing wrong as well.

87
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,120
Now to get alerts about your upcoming costs,

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,683
the best thing to do is to go into creating an AWS budget.

89
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,790
So I am now in the budget console,

90
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,130
and I'm going to create a budget in here

91
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,600
so that we can track our cost

92
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,310
and we can make sure we receive alerts

93
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,350
if we're about to hit our limits.

94
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,880
So here are some templates,

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,980
so we have user templates,

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,950
and then we can go into a zero spend budget

97
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,750
that creates a budget that notifies you

98
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,960
once your spending exceeds the free tier limits.

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,720
So in that case, I will have my Zero Spend Budget,

100
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,890
this is good.

101
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,780
And we can have email recipients,

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,643
so stephane@example.com.

103
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,300
And then you will be notified via email

104
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,760
for any spend is incurred.

105
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,680
So let's create this budget,

106
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,753
and that's one budget right here.

107
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,130
And then, I can create a second budget if I wanted to.

108
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,250
And again, we're going to use a simplified template

109
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,070
and we're going to go for monthly cost budgets

110
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,750
and this is the amount of cost

111
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,450
that we want to budget for our cloud.

112
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,430
So for example, I can say that

113
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,209
I don't wanna spend any more than $10, so I put 10 here.

114
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,460
And then, the email recipients,

115
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,620
so again, stephane@example.com,

116
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,960
and then I will be notified actually

117
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,370
if my actual spend reaches 85% or 100%,

118
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,120
or if my forecasted spend is expected to reach 100%.

119
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
So this is another way to set the budgets,

120
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,360
and let's click on Create Budgets, and we're good to go.

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,193
So that's it, of course,

122
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,910
my zero spend budget has been exceeded

123
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,200
because I am already in an account

124
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,630
that has been some charges, so as you can see,

125
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,570
we have an alert and I would receive an email.

126
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,403
And so, that's it,

127
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,720
with this you know how to explore your bills,

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,550
you know how to explore your free tier,

129
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,290
you know how to set up a budget

130
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,910
so that you can track your cost

131
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,390
for monthly budget costs or for free tier costs.

132
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,590
And that should be enough for you

133
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,780
to control your costs in this course.

134
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
Okay, I hope you liked this lecture,

135
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,623
and I will see you in the next lecture.
